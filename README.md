Bank Transaction Fraud Detection System
End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Financial Risk Mitigation

📌 Executive Summary
Financial fraud results in billions of dollars in annual losses globally. This project presents a production-oriented Machine Learning solution designed to detect fraudulent bank transactions with high recall and controlled false positive rates.

The system leverages advanced feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and model optimization techniques to identify high-risk transactions in near real-time.

This project demonstrates strong competencies in:

Applied Machine Learning

Risk Analytics

Feature Engineering

Model Evaluation for Imbalanced Data

Business-Oriented Data Science

🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to build a fraud detection model that:

Maximizes Fraud Detection Rate (Recall)

Minimizes False Positives

Reduces financial loss

Enhances trust and compliance

Supports scalable deployment in banking systems

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of anonymized transactional records including:

Transaction ID

Customer ID

Transaction Amount

Timestamp

Merchant Category

Account Balance

Transaction Type

Fraud Indicator (Target Variable)

Fraud cases represent a minority class, creating a highly imbalanced classification problem.

🧠 Technical Approach
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Missing value handling

Label encoding / One-hot encoding

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Outlier treatment

Train-test split with stratification

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Fraud vs Legitimate transaction distribution

Amount distribution analysis

Correlation matrix

Time-based anomaly trends

Customer behavior patterns

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
Transaction frequency per customer

Rolling average transaction value

Time difference between transactions

Behavioral deviation features

High-risk merchant indicators

4️⃣ Class Imbalance Handling
To address skewed data:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Class-weight tuning

Threshold optimization

5️⃣ Model Development
Models implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost (if applicable)

Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV.

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
Since fraud detection is an imbalanced classification problem, accuracy alone is insufficient.

Primary metrics used:

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix

Precision-Recall Curve

Priority was given to maximizing Recall to reduce financial risk from undetected fraud.



📊 Business Impact
If deployed in a real banking environment, this system can:

Reduce fraud-related financial losses

Improve transaction monitoring efficiency

Automate risk scoring

Support regulatory compliance

📌 Key Skills Demonstrated
Advanced Feature Engineering

Imbalanced Classification Handling

Hyperparameter Optimization

Model Evaluation Strategy
